Here is a LED light I built a few months ago.

It's built of plywood, some wallpaper and a few LED strips.

## Preparation

I searched a nice figure I want to cut. On wikipedia I found a [triskele](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triskelion#mediaviewer/File:Triskele-Symbol1.svg) as svg so it could be easily resized and printed.

For printing I couldn't find a program for printing images on DIN A4 paper for linux, so I used [Easy Poster Printer](http://sur.ly/o/gdsoftware.dk/More.aspx%3Fid%3D3/AA001290) for Windows.

Then I glued the paper on the wood and used a pin to stick through the paper and mark the form in the wood.

To cut the wood I used a fretsaw to be more accurate than with a jigsaw and sandpaper for rounding.

## Decoration

Then the wallpaper is glued to the wood and the paper flaps are wrapped around the edges to prevent it from separating.

## Wallmount

To mount the light on the wall I planned to use two metal hooks, but the distance to the wall was a bit too far. So I used a perforated foundation tie and bend it, so that it holds the metal bracket.

## Electrics

As backlight I used a RGB-LED strip with 60 LEDs/m from ebay. They can be cut every few centimeters and have a self-adhesive background. If you chose a form with less curves you avoid a few cuts from the strip, which is not bendable.

I currently use the provided controller and remote, which has limited functions but enough for daily usage. Someday I'll replace the controller with ip capability.
