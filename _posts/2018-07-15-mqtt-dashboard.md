If you ever develop something with mqtt, you might need a client to send some test messages and view the published messages. To generate a simple dashboard with buttons and subscribers to different topics, a friend of mine and I created a webapp.

The Code can be found on github at [https://github.com/DirkHeinke/mqttDashboard](https://github.com/DirkHeinke/mqttDashboard) and a running demo is here: [http://mqttdashboard.dirkheinke.de/](http://mqttdashboard.dirkheinke.de/)
